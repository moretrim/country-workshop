# The Country Workshop

Description
-----------

A collection of countries designed on a whim. Sometimes collaboratively, often haphazardly. The main
appeal is usually the added challenge these countries provide, or putting a fresh twist on an
existing part of the world.

Please note that the countries or their features are not always based on anything historical or
historically plausible. It’s fair to consider most of them fantasy countries. See the [feature
levels](#feature-levels) for a more in-depth explanation.

This is a submod for [HFM] and should not be played standalone.

[HFM]: https://github.com/SighPie/HFM

<!-- release & instructions TBD

Installation
------------

Since this is a submod, you need the [Historical Flavour Mod][HFM] installed already. Follow
instructions there to install it if you haven’t already.

Grab the [1.0 release].

[1.0 release]: https://github.com/moretrim/country-workshop/releases/tag/v1.0

Install this as you would any other mod. When installed properly, the `country_workshop.mod` file
and the `country-workshop` directory should live side-by-side. In the Victoria 2 launcher you should
see an entry for the mod:

![launcher](./launcher.jpg)

The `20: ` prefix should ensure that the submod appears *before* the underlying mod. If it doesn’t
the submod might not work correctly. (For advanced use, this prefix can be modified to tweak load
order.) Make sure you are loading *both* the submod & [HFM], as indicated by the check marks.
