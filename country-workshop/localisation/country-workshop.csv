country-workshop.unite-the-hanseatic-league_desc;With the restoration of our influence in all spheres of European trade, the time has come to right the greatest tragedy of the League’s collapse. The Low Countries were once a collection of states with whom trade of all forms was greatly encouraged. With the end of our golden age and the office of Stadtholder becoming hereditary, the Netherlands entered the world’s stage as a more consolidated and centralised state. By capitalising on dominance in the Moluccas and the broader East Indies it became a dreadful protectionist institution.\n\nIt is time once more for a foreign flag to ensure that in the Low Countries trade reigns supreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
